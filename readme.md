# About this project

Whenver my doctor runs a lab test, I get the results in a PDF. This is annoying because if I want to manipulate or visuzlize the data in any way, I have to manually copy the data to a spreadsheet.

But I'd like to be able to see how the data changes over time.

So I'm working on extracting health lab data from PDFs to be able to manipulate and visualize it with Python.
